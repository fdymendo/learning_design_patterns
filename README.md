# learning_design_patterns

Building a project with ChatGPT using design patterns is an exciting endeavor that combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence with tried-and-true software design techniques. ChatGPT is a large language model trained by OpenAI that uses natural language processing to generate human-like responses to user input. By combining ChatGPT with design patterns, we can create chatbots and other conversational interfaces that are more efficient, maintainable, and scalable.

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a framework for organizing code and separating concerns, making it easier to maintain, modify, and extend the software over time. There are many different design patterns to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. By selecting the right patterns for our project, we can ensure that our code is well-organized, efficient, and easy to maintain.

One potential project that could leverage design patterns with ChatGPT is a language-learning chatbot. The chatbot would allow users to practice their language skills by engaging in conversations with the bot. To build this chatbot, we could use several design patterns, including the Singleton Pattern, Factory Method Pattern, and State Pattern. Each of these patterns would help us to manage user sessions, create different types of conversation objects, and manage the bot's state during a conversation.

## Creational

Creational design patterns are a set of design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner that is suitable to the situation at hand. These patterns provide flexibility and encapsulation to the code and allow for the easy addition of new object creation mechanisms.

There are five main creational design patterns:

1. Singleton Pattern: Ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.
2. Factory Method Pattern: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
3. Abstract Factory Pattern: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
4. Builder Pattern: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
5. Prototype Pattern: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

These patterns are useful in situations where there is a need to create objects in a controlled and flexible manner, ensuring that the correct objects are created with the correct properties and configurations. By using these patterns, developers can separate the creation of objects from their use, allowing for better maintainability and extensibility of the codebase.

### Factory Method

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. It is used when we want to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client, and when the type of objects to be created may vary based on different conditions.

Here are two examples of the Factory Method pattern:

1. File Reader Factory: suppose we have a program that deals with different file formats such as text files, XML files, and CSV files. We can use the Factory Method pattern to create different file reader objects depending on the type of file. The FileReaderFactory is an abstract class that defines the factory method for creating FileReader objects. The subclasses of FileReaderFactory can then implement this method to create specific file reader objects.

2. Pizza Factory: suppose we have a pizza restaurant that serves different types of pizzas such as Margherita, Pepperoni, and Vegetarian. We can use the Factory Method pattern to create different pizza objects depending on the type of pizza. The PizzaFactory is an abstract class that defines the factory method for creating Pizza objects. The subclasses of PizzaFactory can then implement this method to create specific pizza objects based on the type of pizza requested by the customer.

### Abstract factory

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows clients to create objects without knowing the exact types of objects they are creating, and it supports changing the product families being created by changing the factory object.

Here are two examples of the Abstract Factory pattern:

1. GUI Abstract Factory: suppose we have a program that needs to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for different platforms such as Windows, Mac, and Linux. We can use the Abstract Factory pattern to create different sets of GUI objects depending on the platform. The GUIFactory is an abstract class that defines the interface for creating families of GUI objects. The subclasses of GUIFactory can then implement this interface to create specific GUI objects for different platforms.

2. Car Abstract Factory: suppose we have a car manufacturing company that produces different types of cars such as Sedans, SUVs, and Hatchbacks. We can use the Abstract Factory pattern to create different sets of car objects depending on the type of car.

The CarFactory is an abstract class that defines the interface for creating families of car objects. The subclasses of CarFactory can then implement this interface to create specific car objects based on the type of car requested by the customer. The different types of cars may have different engines, tires, and other components, and the CarFactory ensures that all components are compatible and work together seamlessly.

### Builder

Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. It provides a flexible solution to the problem of creating complex objects, by breaking down the creation process into smaller steps and allowing each step to be customized by the client.

Here are two examples of the Builder Pattern:

1. Meal Builder: suppose we have a fast-food restaurant that offers different meal combos such as burger meals, chicken meals, and vegetarian meals. We can use the Builder Pattern to create different meal combos depending on the customer's preferences. The MealBuilder is an abstract class that defines the interface for building different meal combos. The subclasses of MealBuilder can then implement this interface to build specific meal combos, by adding different items such as burgers, fries, drinks, and desserts. The customer can then customize their meal by selecting the items they want, and the MealBuilder ensures that all the items are combined correctly.

2. House Builder: suppose we have a construction company that builds different types of houses such as single-story houses, multi-story houses, and duplex houses. We can use the Builder Pattern to create different house designs depending on the customer's requirements. The HouseBuilder is an abstract class that defines the interface for building different house designs. The subclasses of HouseBuilder can then implement this interface to build specific house designs, by adding different components such as walls, floors, roofs, doors, and windows. The customer can then customize their house by selecting the components they want, and the HouseBuilder ensures that all the components are combined correctly to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing house design.

### Prototype

Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows an object to create a copy of itself. It provides a way to clone an existing object to create a new object without requiring knowledge of its concrete class. This pattern is useful when creating complex objects is costly or time-consuming, and we want to create new objects that are similar to existing objects.

Here are two examples of the Prototype Pattern:

1. Car Prototype: suppose we have a car manufacturing company that produces different models of cars such as Sedans, SUVs, and Hatchbacks. We can use the Prototype Pattern to create new cars by cloning existing cars of the same model.
The Car class is the prototype that defines the interface for cloning itself. The Sedan, SUV, and Hatchback subclasses of Car can then implement this interface to create specific types of cars. The customer can then request a new car of a specific model, and the Car prototype will create a clone of an existing car of that model, rather than creating a new car from scratch.

2. GUI Prototype: suppose we have a program that needs to create a graphical user interface (GUI) with different components such as buttons, text boxes, and menus. We can use the Prototype Pattern to create new GUI components by cloning existing components of the same type. The GUIComponent class is the prototype that defines the interface for cloning itself. The Button, TextBox, and Menu subclasses of GUIComponent can then implement this interface to create specific types of GUI components. The program can then create new GUI components by cloning existing components of the same type, rather than creating new components from scratch. This approach can improve performance and reduce the amount of code needed to create new GUI components.

### Singleton

Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is often used when we want to limit the number of instances of a class to one, to ensure that all objects in the system can access the same instance of the class.

Here are two examples of the Singleton Pattern:

1. Configuration Singleton: suppose we have a program that needs to read configuration settings from a file and provide these settings to other objects in the program. We can use the Singleton Pattern to create a Configuration class that reads the configuration file once and provides access to the configuration settings to all objects in the program. The Configuration class is the singleton class that ensures that only one instance of the class is created. The class reads the configuration file when it is first accessed and stores the configuration settings in memory. The program can then access the configuration settings through the Configuration instance, which is globally accessible.

2. Logger Singleton: suppose we have a program that needs to log messages to a file or a database. We can use the Singleton Pattern to create a Logger class that provides a global point of access to a single instance of the class. The Logger class is the singleton class that ensures that only one instance of the class is created. The class provides methods to log messages to a file or a database and can be accessed from any part of the program. The Logger class can also provide additional functionality such as filtering, formatting, and error handling. By using a singleton Logger class, we can ensure that all messages are logged to a single location and prevent multiple instances of the logger from causing conflicts or inconsistencies in the log data.

## Behavioral

Behavioral design patterns are a set of design patterns that deal with the interactions and communications between objects and classes. These patterns help to manage complex behaviors and ensure that objects and classes are properly organized and interact with each other in a flexible and maintainable manner.

There are twelve main behavioral design patterns:

1. Chain of Responsibility Pattern: Allows a set of objects to handle requests in a chain, each object either handling the request or passing it to the next handler in the chain.
2. Command Pattern: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing the object to be passed as a parameter and stored for later use or undo/redo functionality.
3. Interpreter Pattern: Defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to evaluate sentences in that language.
4. Iterator Pattern: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
5. Mediator Pattern: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling between objects by allowing them to interact through the mediator.
6. Memento Pattern: Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state, allowing for undo/redo functionality.
Observer Pattern: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
7. State Pattern: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, providing a clear separation between state-specific behavior and general behavior.
8. Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable within that family.
9. Template Method Pattern: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
10. Visitor Pattern: Allows new operations to be added to an object structure without modifying the objects themselves.

These patterns are useful in situations where there is a need to manage complex interactions and behaviors between objects and classes, promoting loose coupling, and ensuring that objects and classes are properly organized and interact with each other in a flexible and maintainable manner. By using these patterns, developers can create more robust and extensible software systems.

### Facade

Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, making it easier to use. It is useful when we want to hide the complexity of a system and provide a simple interface for clients to interact with.

Here are two examples of the Facade Pattern:

1. Home Theater System: suppose we have a program that simulates a home theater system, and we want to provide a simple interface for clients to interact with. We can use the Facade Pattern to create a HomeTheaterFacade class that provides a simple interface for turning on/off the system, adjusting the volume, and playing a movie.
The HomeTheaterFacade class contains references to several classes such as Amplifier, DVDPlayer, and Projector. It hides the complexity of the system and provides a simple interface for clients to interact with. Clients can simply call the methods of the HomeTheaterFacade class to perform actions on the system.

2. Hotel Booking System: suppose we have a program that allows clients to book a hotel room, and we want to provide a simple interface for clients to interact with. We can use the Facade Pattern to create a HotelBookingFacade class that provides a simple interface for searching for available rooms, booking a room, and cancelling a booking. The HotelBookingFacade class contains references to several classes such as RoomInventory, Reservation, and Payment. It hides the complexity of the system and provides a simple interface for clients to interact with. Clients can simply call the methods of the HotelBookingFacade class to perform actions on the system.

### Chain Responsability

Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows us to chain together objects and pass a request through the chain until one of the objects handles the request. It is useful when we have a group of objects that can handle a request, but we don't know which object should handle the request at runtime.

Here are two examples of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern:

1. Employee Leave Approval: suppose we have a company with multiple levels of management, and we want to automate the process of approving employee leave requests. We can use the Chain of Responsibility Pattern to create a chain of approval objects.
Each approval object represents a level of management, and it can approve or reject a leave request. When an employee submits a leave request, the request is passed through the chain of approval objects until it is approved or rejected by one of the objects. For example, if the employee's immediate supervisor can approve the request, the request is passed to the supervisor object. If the supervisor cannot approve the request, the request is passed to the manager object, and so on until the request is approved or rejected. This approach simplifies the process of leave approval by automating the process and reduces the workload of HR managers.

2. Request Processing: suppose we have a program that receives requests from multiple sources, and we want to process the requests based on their type. We can use the Chain of Responsibility Pattern to create a chain of request processing objects.
Each processing object represents a type of request, and it can handle the request if it is of the correct type. When a request is received, it is passed through the chain of processing objects until it is handled by one of the objects. For example, if the request is a HTTP request, it is passed to the HTTP processing object. If the request is a TCP request, it is passed to the TCP processing object, and so on until the request is handled by one of the objects. This approach simplifies the process of request handling by automating the process and reduces the complexity of the request handling code.


### Command

Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing us to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. It is useful when we want to decouple an object that invokes an operation from the object that knows how to perform the operation.

Here are two examples of the Command Pattern:

1. Remote Control: suppose we have a remote control that can control multiple devices such as a TV, a stereo, and a DVD player. We can use the Command Pattern to create command objects that represent different actions such as turning on the TV, changing the channel, or adjusting the volume.
Each command object encapsulates the logic for performing a specific action on a specific device. When a button on the remote control is pressed, it invokes the corresponding command object, which performs the action on the corresponding device. This approach allows us to decouple the remote control from the devices it controls, and also allows us to add new devices and commands easily.

2. Transactional Processing:
Suppose we have a banking application that processes transactions such as transferring funds, depositing money, and withdrawing money. We can use the Command Pattern to create command objects that represent different transactions. Each command object encapsulates the logic for performing a specific transaction. When a transaction is initiated, a corresponding command object is created and added to a command queue. The command queue is processed sequentially, with each command object executing its corresponding transaction. This approach allows us to decouple the transaction processing logic from the rest of the application, and also allows us to support undoable transactions. We can implement undo by creating an inverse command object for each command object, which performs the opposite of the original transaction. When an undo is initiated, the inverse command objects are processed in reverse order to undo the transactions.

### Iterator

The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing the underlying representation of the object. It allows you to iterate over a collection of objects without having to know the details of the collection's implementation.

The basic components of the Iterator pattern are the Iterator, the Aggregate, and the ConcreteIterator. The Iterator defines an interface for accessing the elements of the Aggregate. The Aggregate defines an interface for creating an Iterator. The ConcreteIterator implements the Iterator interface and keeps track of the current position in the Aggregate.

Two examples of implementation of the Iterator pattern are:

1. Java's Iterator Interface: the Java Collections Framework provides an Iterator interface which allows you to traverse a collection of objects without having to know the underlying implementation of the collection. The Iterator interface has methods for checking if there are more elements in the collection, getting the next element, and removing the current element.

2. Custom Iterator for a Music Collection: suppose you have a collection of music albums and you want to be able to iterate over the collection to display information about each album. You can create a custom iterator that implements the Iterator interface and uses an ArrayList to store the collection of albums. The iterator would have methods for checking if there are more albums in the collection, getting the next album, and removing the current album. This way, you can iterate over the music collection without having to know the details of how the collection is implemented.


### Mediator

The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral pattern that promotes loose coupling by enabling communication between objects through a mediator object. It defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact with each other, decoupling the objects from each other and promoting a more modular and maintainable design.

Here's a brief description of how the Mediator Pattern works:

Objects within a system need to communicate with each other.
Rather than communicating directly with each other, the objects communicate through a mediator object.
The mediator object encapsulates the communication logic between the objects.

Two examples of implementation of the Mediator Pattern are:

1. Java's Event Handling Mechanism: java's event handling mechanism uses the Mediator Pattern to allow communication between event sources and event listeners. When an event occurs, the event source sends a message to the mediator object, which then forwards the message to the appropriate event listener. This decouples the event source and event listener, making it easier to add or remove event listeners without affecting the event source.

2. Online Marketplace: an online marketplace can use the Mediator Pattern to facilitate communication between buyers and sellers. The mediator object acts as an intermediary between the buyers and sellers, enabling them to communicate and negotiate with each other without directly interacting. This promotes a more secure and efficient marketplace, as buyers and sellers do not need to share their personal information or interact directly with each other.

Overall, the Mediator Pattern promotes loose coupling by enabling communication between objects through a mediator object. It is useful in situations where objects need to communicate with each other but should not be tightly coupled. The Mediator Pattern can be applied in a wide range of contexts, from event handling to online marketplaces.

### Memento

The Memento Pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to capture and save its internal state so that it can be restored later, without violating encapsulation. It is used to provide a way to store and restore the state of an object without exposing its internal details to the rest of the system.

Here's a brief description of how the Memento Pattern works:

An object (the Originator) creates a Memento object that contains a snapshot of its current state.
The Memento object is passed to a caretaker object for safekeeping.
Later, the Originator can request that the caretaker restore its state from the Memento.

Two examples of implementation of the Memento Pattern are:

1. Text Editors: a text editor can use the Memento Pattern to implement an "Undo" feature. Each time the user performs an action (such as typing, deleting, or copying text), the editor creates a Memento object that captures the editor's state. The Memento is then passed to a caretaker object (such as a history buffer) for safekeeping. If the user later chooses to undo an action, the editor can request that the caretaker restore the editor's state from the appropriate Memento.

2. Games: a game can use the Memento Pattern to implement a "Save Game" feature. When the player reaches a certain checkpoint or completes a level, the game creates a Memento object that captures the game's state (such as the player's health, location, and progress). The Memento is then passed to a caretaker object (such as a save game manager) for safekeeping. If the player later chooses to resume the game from a saved point, the game can request that the caretaker restore the game's state from the appropriate Memento.

Overall, the Memento Pattern is useful when you need to be able to save and restore the state of an object without exposing its internal details to the rest of the system. It can be applied in a wide range of contexts, from text editors to games.

### Observer

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows one or more objects to be notified of changes to the state of another object. It is used to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects, where changes to one object can automatically trigger updates in the other objects.

Here's a brief description of how the Observer Pattern works:

The Subject (or Observable) is the object that needs to be monitored for changes to its state.
The Observers are the objects that need to be notified of changes to the Subject's state.
When the Subject's state changes, it notifies all of its Observers by calling a method on each Observer.
Each Observer can then retrieve the updated state of the Subject and take appropriate action.
Two examples of implementation of the Observer Pattern are:

1. Stock Market: a stock market can use the Observer Pattern to notify investors of changes in stock prices. The market would act as the Subject, while the investors would act as Observers. When the price of a stock changes, the market would notify all of its investors by calling a method on each Observer. Each investor could then retrieve the updated stock price and decide whether to buy, sell, or hold their shares.

2. Weather Station: a weather station can use the Observer Pattern to notify people of changes in weather conditions. The station would act as the Subject, while people (such as hikers or farmers) would act as Observers. When the weather changes (such as a drop in temperature or an increase in wind speed), the station would notify all of its Observers by calling a method on each one. Each person could then retrieve the updated weather conditions and decide whether to change their plans (such as staying indoors or wearing warmer clothing).

Overall, the Observer Pattern is useful when you need to establish a one-to-many relationship between objects, where changes to one object need to be automatically propagated to other objects. It can be applied in a wide range of contexts, from stock markets to weather stations.

### State

The State Pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It is useful when an object needs to perform different operations based on its current state, and when adding new states can lead to a lot of conditional statements.

Here's a brief description of how the State Pattern works:

The Context is the object that needs to change its behavior based on its internal state.
The State is an interface or abstract class that defines the behavior of the Context based on its internal state.
Concrete State classes implement the State interface or abstract class and provide different implementations of the behavior based on the internal state of the Context.
When the internal state of the Context changes, it updates its current State object to the appropriate Concrete State object.

Two examples of implementation of the State Pattern are:

1. Vending Machine: a vending machine can use the State Pattern to change its behavior based on the amount of money inserted and the availability of the selected item. The vending machine would act as the Context, while the different states (such as "No Money", "Not Enough Money", "Enough Money", "Sold Out") would act as Concrete State classes. When a user inserts money and selects an item, the vending machine would update its internal state and change its behavior accordingly (such as dispensing the item or returning the money).

2. Traffic Light: a traffic light can use the State Pattern to change its behavior based on the current state of traffic flow. The traffic light would act as the Context, while the different states (such as "Green Light", "Yellow Light", "Red Light") would act as Concrete State classes. When traffic flow changes (such as heavy traffic or an accident), the traffic light would update its internal state and change its behavior accordingly (such as extending the duration of the red light).

Overall, the State Pattern is useful when an object needs to change its behavior based on its internal state, and when adding new states can lead to a lot of conditional statements. It can be applied in a wide range of contexts, from vending machines to traffic lights.

### Strategy

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable. It allows you to change the behavior of an object at runtime without changing the implementation of the object itself.

Here's a brief description of how the Strategy Pattern works:

The Context is the object that needs to perform a particular behavior.
The Strategy is an interface or abstract class that defines the behavior that the Context can use.
Concrete Strategy classes implement the Strategy interface or abstract class and provide different implementations of the behavior.
The Context holds a reference to a Strategy object and delegates behavior to it.

Two examples of implementation of the Strategy Pattern are:

1. Sorting Algorithms: a sorting algorithm can use the Strategy Pattern to change its behavior based on the type of data being sorted. The sorting algorithm would act as the Context, while the different sorting algorithms (such as "Bubble Sort", "Quick Sort", "Merge Sort") would act as Concrete Strategy classes. When a user wants to sort a particular dataset, the sorting algorithm would delegate the sorting behavior to the appropriate sorting strategy.

2. Payment Processing: a payment processing system can use the Strategy Pattern to change its behavior based on the payment method being used. The payment processing system would act as the Context, while the different payment methods (such as "Credit Card", "PayPal", "Venmo") would act as Concrete Strategy classes. When a user wants to make a payment, the payment processing system would delegate the payment behavior to the appropriate payment strategy.

Overall, the Strategy Pattern is useful when you need to change the behavior of an object at runtime without changing the implementation of the object itself. It can be applied in a wide range of contexts, from sorting algorithms to payment processing systems.

### Visitor

The Visitor Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to add new operations or behaviors to an object without modifying the object itself. It is based on the principle of separating the algorithm from the object structure on which it operates.

The Visitor Pattern consists of four main components:

Visitor: an abstract class or interface that defines a set of methods, each corresponding to a specific operation or behavior that can be performed on an object structure.
ConcreteVisitor: a concrete class that implements the Visitor interface and provides the actual implementation for the operations defined by the Visitor.

Element: an abstract class or interface that defines a set of methods that allow the Visitor to access and operate on the elements of the object structure.

ConcreteElement: a concrete class that implements the Element interface and provides the actual implementation for the methods defined by the Element.

The Visitor Pattern works by allowing the Visitor to visit each element in the object structure, and then perform the appropriate operation or behavior on that element. This is accomplished by having the Element accept the Visitor, which then calls the appropriate method on the Visitor.

Two examples of implementation of the Visitor Pattern are:

1. Tax Calculation: un a financial application, the Visitor Pattern can be used to implement tax calculation. The Element interface would define methods to traverse the different types of financial transactions, while the Concrete Elements would represent the different types of transactions, such as stocks or bonds. The Visitor interface would define methods to perform specific operations on the transactions, such as calculating the tax owed.

2. Game Development: in a game development application, the Visitor Pattern can be used to implement game object interactions. The Element interface would define methods to traverse the different game objects, while the Concrete Elements would represent the different types of game objects, such as enemies or power-ups. The Visitor interface would define methods to perform specific operations on the game objects, such as applying damage to enemies or awarding points for collecting power-ups.

Overall, the Visitor Pattern is a powerful tool for adding new behaviors to an object structure without modifying the objects themselves. It is widely used in a variety of applications, including financial systems and game development.

## Structural

Structural patterns in software engineering are used to design and organize objects in a way that improves the efficiency and flexibility of the system. They focus on the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures, rather than the behavior of individual objects. These patterns are particularly useful for creating complex systems that are easy to maintain and extend.

Some common examples of structural patterns include:

1. Adapter Pattern: This pattern allows the interface of an existing class to be used by another interface without modifying the original class. It is useful when two incompatible interfaces need to be connected together.

2. Bridge Pattern: This pattern separates an abstraction from its implementation so that both can be modified independently. It is useful when you want to vary both the abstraction and its implementation independently.

3. Composite Pattern: This pattern allows you to treat a group of objects in the same way as a single object. It is useful when you want to create a hierarchy of objects, where each object can be treated as a leaf or a composite node.

4.Decorator Pattern: This pattern allows you to add new functionality to an object by wrapping it with another object. It is useful when you want to add functionality to an object at runtime without affecting other instances of the same class.

5. Facade Pattern: This pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It is useful when you want to simplify a complex system by providing a single interface that clients can use to access the system.

6. Flyweight Pattern: This pattern minimizes memory usage by sharing common state between multiple objects. It is useful when you need to create a large number of objects with similar properties, but you don't want to create a new object for each one.

7. Proxy Pattern: This pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder object that controls access to another object. It is useful when you want to provide controlled access to an object, or when you want to add additional functionality to an object without changing its interface.

Overall, structural patterns help to create a more flexible and maintainable system by providing a way to organize objects and classes in a clear and consistent manner.

### Adapter

Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by creating a bridge between them. It is useful when we have an existing class with a specific interface that we want to use in a different context where a different interface is required.

Here are two examples of the Adapter Pattern:

1. Socket Adapter: suppose we have a program that needs to connect to a network using a specific type of socket interface, but the network uses a different socket interface. We can use the Adapter Pattern to create a SocketAdapter class that translates between the two socket interfaces. The SocketAdapter class is the adapter that provides the bridge between the two socket interfaces. It takes a socket object of the incompatible interface and adapts it to the required interface by implementing the required methods and translating the data between the two interfaces. The program can then use the SocketAdapter to connect to the network using the required socket interface.

2. JSON Adapter: suppose we have a program that uses a specific data format such as XML, but we need to work with data that is in a different format such as JSON. We can use the Adapter Pattern to create a JSONAdapter class that translates between the two data formats. The JSONAdapter class is the adapter that provides the bridge between the two data formats. It takes a JSON object and adapts it to the required XML format by implementing the required methods and translating the data between the two formats. The program can then use the JSONAdapter to work with data that is in a different format than the one it was designed for.

### Bridge

Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that both can vary independently. It is useful when we want to separate an abstraction's interface from its implementation so that we can change either one without affecting the other.

Here are two examples of the Bridge Pattern:

1. Shape Drawing Bridge: suppose we have a program that needs to draw different shapes such as circles, rectangles, and triangles, but we want to be able to draw them using different rendering techniques such as raster or vector. We can use the Bridge Pattern to create a Shape class that defines the shape's properties and a DrawingAPI class that defines the rendering technique. The Shape class is the abstraction that defines the interface for the shape's properties, such as its position and size. The DrawingAPI class is the implementation that defines the rendering technique, such as raster or vector. The Shape class has a reference to the DrawingAPI class, which allows the shape to be rendered using the selected rendering technique. By separating the shape's properties from the rendering technique, we can change either one without affecting the other.

2. Notification Bridge: suppose we have a program that needs to send notifications to different devices such as email, SMS, and push notifications, but we want to be able to send them using different notification services such as Gmail or Twilio. We can use the Bridge Pattern to create a Notification class that defines the notification's properties and a NotificationService class that defines the notification service. The Notification class is the abstraction that defines the interface for the notification's properties, such as its message and recipient. The NotificationService class is the implementation that defines the notification service, such as Gmail or Twilio. The Notification class has a reference to the NotificationService class, which allows the notification to be sent using the selected notification service. By separating the notification's properties from the notification service, we can change either one without affecting the other.

### Composite

Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows us to treat a group of objects in the same way as a single object. It is useful when we want to create a hierarchy of objects where each object can be treated as an individual object or as part of a larger group of objects.

Here are two examples of the Composite Pattern:

1. File System Tree: suppose we have a program that needs to work with a file system that consists of files and directories. We can use the Composite Pattern to create a FileSystemItem interface that defines the methods for working with files and directories, and a Directory class that represents a directory and contains a list of FileSystemItem objects. The Directory class is a composite object that contains a list of FileSystemItem objects. It can be treated as a single object, but it also contains a list of other FileSystemItem objects that can be treated as individual objects. This allows us to create a hierarchy of directories and files that can be easily manipulated using the same interface.

2. Organization Chart: suppose we have a program that needs to work with an organization chart that consists of employees and departments. We can use the Composite Pattern to create an Employee interface that defines the methods for working with employees and a Department class that represents a department and contains a list of Employee objects. The Department class is a composite object that contains a list of Employee objects. It can be treated as a single object, but it also contains a list of other Employee objects that can be treated as individual objects. This allows us to create a hierarchy of departments and employees that can be easily manipulated using the same interface.

### Decorator

Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows us to add new behavior to an object dynamically without changing its original class. It is useful when we want to add functionality to an object at runtime without modifying its original behavior.

Here are two examples of the Decorator Pattern:

1. Coffee Shop: suppose we have a program that simulates a coffee shop, and we want to allow customers to order different types of coffee with different toppings. We can use the Decorator Pattern to create a Coffee interface that defines the methods for working with coffee and a BaseCoffee class that represents a basic coffee.
We can then create several decorators such as Milk, Sugar, and Caramel that add new behavior to the BaseCoffee class. Each decorator implements the same Coffee interface, and it contains a reference to the BaseCoffee class. This allows us to add new behavior to the BaseCoffee class at runtime without changing its original behavior.

2. Car Options: suppose we have a program that allows customers to configure a car with different options such as leather seats, sunroof, and navigation. We can use the Decorator Pattern to create a Car interface that defines the methods for working with a car and a BaseCar class that represents a basic car.
We can then create several decorators such as LeatherSeats, Sunroof, and Navigation that add new behavior to the BaseCar class. Each decorator implements the same Car interface, and it contains a reference to the BaseCar class. This allows us to add new options to the BaseCar class at runtime without changing its original behavior.


### Flyweight

Flyweight Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows us to share common parts of objects among multiple objects, reducing memory usage and improving performance. It is useful when we have a large number of similar objects and we want to optimize memory usage and performance.

Here are two examples of the Flyweight Pattern:

1. Text Editor: suppose we have a program that simulates a text editor, and we want to allow users to change the formatting of text such as font, size, and color. We can use the Flyweight Pattern to create a FontFactory class that maintains a pool of Font objects. Each Font object represents a specific font, size, and color combination. When a user selects a font, the FontFactory class checks if a Font object with the same properties already exists in the pool. If it does, it returns the existing Font object. Otherwise, it creates a new Font object and adds it to the pool. This approach reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of Font objects among multiple text objects and improves performance by avoiding the creation of duplicate Font objects.

2. Music Streaming Service: suppose we have a program that allows users to stream music and create playlists. We want to optimize memory usage and improve performance by using the Flyweight Pattern.
We can use the Flyweight Pattern to create a SongFactory class that maintains a pool of Song objects. Each Song object represents a specific song with its metadata such as title, artist, and duration. When a user adds a song to a playlist, the SongFactory class checks if a Song object with the same metadata already exists in the pool. If it does, it returns the existing Song object. Otherwise, it creates a new Song object and adds it to the pool. This approach reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of Song objects among multiple playlists and improves performance by avoiding the creation of duplicate Song objects.

### Proxy

Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It is useful when we want to control access to an object, either to add additional functionality or to restrict access.

Here are two examples of the Proxy Pattern:

1. Image Loading: suppose we have a program that displays a large number of images, and we want to optimize the loading time by using a proxy object. We can use the Proxy Pattern to create an ImageProxy class that acts as a placeholder for the actual Image object.
The ImageProxy class loads the actual Image object only when it is needed. For example, when the user requests to view the image. This approach reduces the loading time by delaying the loading of images until they are actually needed.

2. Bank Account Management: suppose we have a program that allows users to manage their bank accounts, and we want to restrict access to certain methods for security reasons. We can use the Proxy Pattern to create a BankAccountProxy class that controls access to the actual BankAccount object.
The BankAccountProxy class restricts access to certain methods such as transferring funds and changing account details. It only allows access to these methods for authorized users. This approach enhances security by restricting access to sensitive methods of the BankAccount object.
